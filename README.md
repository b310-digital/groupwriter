# GroupWriter

GroupWriter is a collaborative text editing application, similar and influenced by [etherpad](https://etherpad.org). Create and edit documents in real-time with colleagues or friends, while sharing images, adding comments, and making suggestions. File upload is based on s3 compatible storage like minio.

## Demo

## Setup

The application is divided into a backend and frontend folder with separate docker image. 

### Docker Compose for Production

Important: Currently, the backend is expected to run on the subdomain `write-backend` as it is configured within the frontend during build time.

```

      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-groupwriter-password}
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-groupwriter-user}

    # Exposing the port is not needed unless you want to access this database instance from the host.
    # Be careful when other postgres docker container are running on the same port
    ports:
      - "${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata

  minio:
    image: minio/minio
    container_name: minio
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
      - "9001:9001"
    environment:
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: ${DOCKER_COMPOSE_MINIO_USER:-ROOTNAME}
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${DOCKER_COMPOSE_MINIO_PASSWORD:-CHANGEME123}
    volumes:
      - ~/minio/data:/data
    command: server /data --console-address ":9001"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Example for a `.env` file:

```
PORT=3000
DOCKER_COMPOSE_APP_OBJECT_STORAGE_USER=
DOCKER_COMPOSE_APP_OBJECT_STORAGE_PASSWORD=
# needs to be exactly 32 chars
DOCKER_COMPOSE_APP_VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_BASE64=
DOCKER_COMPOSE_APP_FEATURE_REMOVE_DOCUMENTS_TOGGLE=false
DOCKER_COMPOSE_APP_FEATURE_REMOVE_DOCUMENTS_MAX_AGE_IN_DAYS=730

DOCKER_COMPOSE_MINIO_USER=minio
DOCKER_COMPOSE_MINIO_PASSWORD=
```

Then start it:

```
docker compose up -d
```

And visit the app at `localhost:8080`!
